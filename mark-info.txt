beautiful!!!! the only thing I would think of changing is the front page pictures, I would want it to be some of my work, I would rather have as the main image a picture of me working on the fence... I can attach 2 pictures for your consideration. 
Also a new thing I am trying to sell is the 4 foot tall fence. I dont hardly ever sell chain-link so you could have Wood fence/// ornamental fence .. ( I would rather it say Black Metal Fence  :-) just cut the chain-link  and at the bottom put DECORATIVE FENCING and have a pic like this one--

The reason I have been workin on all these ads is because A: I have experienced a drop in sales B: I have been having a hard time with customers trying to delay payment and being CHEAP.  50% of my customers are Black in the last 2 weeks.
Anyways  I sold a job for $1200 and Im doing it tomorrow. Thanks for your help Mike!
